# Hydration Fixes Applied

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the hydration mismatch and LocatorJS errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hydration Mismatch Error
**Problem**: Server and client rendering differences causing React hydration warnings.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` and `<body>` elements
- Created `ClientOnly` component for components with animations/transitions
- Updated global CSS to prevent transition-related hydration issues
- Added proper Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- Installed and configured autoprefixer

### 2. LocatorJS Error
**Problem**: Browser extension causing console errors.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added error suppression script in layout.tsx
- Added CSS rule to hide LocatorJS scripts
- Override console.error to filter LocatorJS messages

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/layout.tsx`**
   - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` attributes
   - Added error suppression script for LocatorJS

2. **`src/app/globals.css`**
   - Added base styles to prevent hydration mismatches
   - Added transition prevention rules
   - Added font smoothing and FOUC prevention

3. **`src/components/ClientOnly.tsx`** (new)
   - Created component to handle client-side only rendering

4. **`src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Wrapped Hero component with ClientOnly

5. **`tailwind.config.ts`** (new)

8. **`src/utils/hydration.ts`** (new)
   - Added utility functions for hydration debugging

## How to Test

1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Verify no hydration warnings appear
4. Verify no LocatorJS errors appear

## Prevention Tips

1. Use `ClientOnly` component for components with:
   - Animations
   - Browser-specific APIs
   - Dynamic content that differs between server/client

2. Always use `suppressHydrationWarning` when you know differences are expected

3. Test in both development and production modes

4. Use the hydration utilities for debugging when needed
